#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs and implement them into a program I start by interviewing a user and work to understand their expectation. Once I learn their expectations I create a user story that includes an expected feature and expected outcome from using that feature. This helps pass on the user expectations to the developers. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I develop programs I work to finish the most important tasks first. I will work in the future to deliver barely working software. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member works to deliver their user story and communicate their needs and works to help others overcome their blocks. They test their program to make sure it is compatible and doesn't break anything else before commiting changes.
